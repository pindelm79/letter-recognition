# Letter Recognition Thesis

This is a public version of my engineering thesis "Application of neural networks in letter recognition". The goal of this project was to build a model (from scratch) and an application which can recognize user-drawn English alphabet letters.

## Installation

As of now, the only way is to download the source code (and set up the environment using poetry.lock).

## Usage

To run the training script, run
```bash
python -m letter_recognition.nn
```
in the top directory.
